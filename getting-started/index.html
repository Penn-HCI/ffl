                <h2>Tutorial: Your First Augmentations</h2>
                <p class="text-muted">FFL is designed to help authors augment formulas with a light-weight syntax and
                    live feedback. With FFL you can add augmentations such as colors and labels to formula by writing a
                    style-sheet-like specification.
                    Here, we showcase some examples of basic features of FFL.</p>
                <p>For this tutorial, you will work on the below excerpt from <a
                        href="https://fredhohman.com/papers/gamut" class="link-underline link-underline-opacity-25"
                        target="_blank">Gamut: A Design Probe to Understand How Data Scientists Understand Machine
                        Learning Models</a> by <a href="https://fredhohman.com/"
                        class="link-underline link-underline-opacity-25" target="_blank">Hohman</a> et al.
                </p>
                <div markdown-root>Consider a dataset $D = \{(x_i ,y_i)\}^N$ of $N$ data points, where $x_i = (x_{i1},
                    x_{i2},\cdots, x_{iM} )$ is a feature vector with $M$ features, and $y_i$ is the target, i.e., the
                    response, variable. Let $x_j$ denote the $j$th variable in feature space. A typical linear
                    regression model can then be expressed mathematically as:

                    $$ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \dots + \beta_M x_M $$

                    This model assumes that the relationships between the target variable $y_i$ and features $x_j$ are
                    linear and can be captured in slope terms $\beta_1$, $\beta_2$, . . . , $\beta_M$.</div>
                <h3>Structure of an FFL Specification</h3>
                <p>An FFL rule is a lot like a CSS rule&mdash;it consists of a selector and a style block. The selector
                    "selects" parts of a formula you want to style and the style block contains a
                    semicolon-separated list of properties specifying what augmentations to apply.</p>
                <p>For example, <code class="language-css">$y$ { color: red }</code> means to select all \(y\)'s in
                    formulas and color them red. Here, <code><span class="token selector">$y$</span></code> is
                    a <i>literal</i> selector, written as <i>literal</i> LaTeX surrounded with a pair of single dollar
                    signs, and <code class="language-css">
                        <span class="token punctuation">{</span> <span class="token property">color</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> red <span class="token punctuation">}</span>
                    </code> is the style block consisting of a single property
                    <code><span class="token property" style="font-size: 16px;">color</span></code>.
                </p>
                <div markdown-root ffl-style="/* try editing the code below! */
$y$ {
  color: red;
}">Consider a dataset $D = \{(x_i ,y_i)\}^N$ of $N$ data points, where $x_i = (x_{i1}, x_{i2},\cdots,x_{iM} )$ is a
                    feature vector with $M$ features, and $y_i$ is the target, i.e., the response, variable. Let $x_j$
                    denote the $j$th variable in feature space. A typical linear regression model can then be expressed
                    mathematically as:

                    $$ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \dots + \beta_M x_M $$

                    This model assumes that the relationships between the target variable $y_i$ and features $x_j$ are
                    linear and can be captured in slope terms $\beta_1$, $\beta_2$, . . . ,$\beta_M$.</div>
                <h3>Selectors</h3>
                <p>So far, we have already seen <i>literal selectors</i> which select parts of formulas directly
                    corresponding
                    to its content. In addition to literal selectors, FFL also supports a few other ways of selecting
                    elements.
                    To see the full list of supported selectors, navigate to <a href="basic-selectors">Selectors</a> on
                    the side bar.
                </p>
                <h4>Wildcards/Globbing</h4>
                <p>One of the core features of FFL is the ability to make cross-cutting changes. This includes the
                    ability to select related elements with wildcard matching.
                    Literal selectors in FFL support <i>wildcards</i> <code>*</code> and <code>?</code> analogous to
                    Unix glob patterns.
                    In other words, <code>?</code> matches a single token and <code>*</code> matches zero or more tokens
                    (bounded by <code>{&hellip;}</code> groups).
                </p>
                <p>For instance, you might have noticed that the selector
                    <code><span class="token selector">$y$</span></code> didn't include subscripts.
                    This might be fine for \(y_i\)'s but it certainly would be cumbersome to select each \(x_i\)'s one
                    by one.
                    Instead, the alternative is to use the wildcards to match all subscripts.
                </p>
                <div markdown-root ffl-style="$y$, $y_?$, *.targ {
  color: red;
}

$x_*$, *.feat {
  color: DodgerBlue;
}">Consider a dataset $D = \{(x_i ,y_i)\}^N$ of $N$ data points, where $x_i = (x_{i1}, x_{i2},\cdots,x_{iM} )$ is a
                    <span class="feat">feature vector</span> with $M$ features, and $y_i$ is the <span
                        class="targ">target</span>, i.e., the response, variable. Let $x_j$ denote the $j$th variable in
                    feature space. A typical linear regression model can then be expressed mathematically as:

                    $$ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \dots + \beta_M x_M $$

                    This model assumes that the relationships between the target variable $y_i$ and features $x_j$ are
                    linear and can be captured in slope terms $\beta_1$, $\beta_2$, . . . ,$\beta_M$.</div>
                <h4>CSS Classes</h4>
                <p>Oftentimes you might want to make some connections between labels and their textual descriptions.
                    FFL doesn't directly support styling of texts, but you can mix in some simple
                    CSS selectors <span class="text-muted">(currently only class selectors are supported)</span>
                    alongside FFL. By default, the scope of FFL selectors are
                    limited to formulas. To select outside of formulas, you simply prepend an asterisk <code>*</code> in front
                    of a class selector to indicate its application outside of the formulas.
                    For example, <code class="language-html">&lt;span class="target"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;</code> here
                    is selected by the selector
                    <code><span class="token selector">*.target</span></code>.
                </p>
                <div markdown-root expand ffl-style="$y$, *.target {
  color: red;
}">Consider a dataset $D = \{(x_i ,y_i)\}^N$ of $N$ data points, where $x_i = (x_{i1}, x_{i2},\cdots,x_{iM} )$ is a
                    feature vector with $M$ features, and $y_i$ is the <span class="target">target</span>, i.e., the
                    response, variable. Let $x_j$ denote the $j$th variable in feature space. A typical linear
                    regression model can then be expressed mathematically as:

                    $$ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \dots + \beta_M x_M $$

                    This model assumes that the relationships between the target variable $y_i$ and features $x_j$ are
                    linear and can be captured in slope terms $\beta_1$, $\beta_2$, . . . ,$\beta_M$.</div>
                <h3>Style Properties</h3>
                <p>Many CSS styles work out of the box, among which the most common is
                    <code><span class="token property">color</span></code>,
                    which we have already seen above.
                    For more on supported properties, navigate to <a href="basic-styles">Style Properties</a> on the
                    side bar.
                    FFL also supports a few additional properties that are specific to math formulas,
                    the primary among which is <code><span class="token property">label</span></code>.
                </p>
                <h4>Labels</h4>
                <p>Of course, colors are not the only way to grab your readers' attention. We find this common enough
                    that
                    adding a label to an element in FFL is as simple as adding a
                    <code><span class="token property">label</span></code> property.
                    Labels are automatically placed wherever there is room. For options to customize labels, read more
                    at <a href="additional-styles#labels">Additional Styles</a>.
                </p>
                <div latex-root show-open ffl-style="$y$ { label: target }
$\beta_0$ { label: intercept }
$\beta_?$:nth(1) { label: slope term }
$x_1$ {
  label: feature;
  label-position: below
}
$M$ { label: # of features }"> y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \dots + \beta_M x_M </div>
                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>To use FFL to style formulas, you can write CSS-like style rules consisting of selectors and
                    declaration blocks.
                    FFL supports a variety of selectors and style properties. For more details, check out more pages on
                    the side bar.
