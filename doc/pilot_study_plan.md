# Pilot Study
> The study will compose of a few questions before and after some tasks involving our formatting language.
> Before we get started with the tasks, would you mind answering some questions?
## Pre-Completion Survey
1. How much experience do you have with LaTeX, especially math mode?
1. How often do you find yourself needing to style math mode beyond just the text & symbols? _e.g._ coloring, labeling elements
2. What do you find difficult about styling LaTeX math?
3. How familiar are you with CSS?
## Preparation
> To get started, I will give you a quick walkthrough of the tool... [[Cheatsheet](cheatsheet.md)]
> 
## Playground/Plain LaTeX
[Test Cases](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a8d9eNxrgMhZWT_57Yika-dyn_KCAWVEBhWWggPq2NA/edit)
## Post-Completion Survey
1. (Scale) How easy do you find using our tool comparing to using regular LaTeX math (including `amsmath` and common packages)?
2. What issues did you have with it? Please rank from most to least frustrating?
   1. disambiguation: override? live is useful, combining, ltr, different from writing (thinking semantically)
   2. More demo/tutorial

3. Were there things you expected to work but didn't? If so, what were they?
   3. Question on overriding
5. What are some things you liked and would like us to keep?
   1. change: combinator instructions: e.g. & use case
   2. keep: optional semicol, dollar sign wasn't so bad after a while
6. Feedback on cheatsheet?
   1. print out high-res, the exact color does not matter

Watch & ask? Could imagine themselves using for their own work? Actual need? Script, setups? Think aloud? Encourage questions? More feature-ful practice
